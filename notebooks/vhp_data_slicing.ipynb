    "# Critical issue found when using train set to finetune: \n",
    "The above datasets contain audio file/ transcript pairs that exceed training/ finetuning requirements for whisper (30 secs). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there's no timestamp provided in the transcripts, we need to apply a technique called forced alignment to break down the transcripts precisely while truncating our media files.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed resolution:\n",
    "- Develop a set of utility functions under /scripts that orchestrate the process of data loading, audio + transcript truncating with forced alignment in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Projected main function of the utilities will orchestrate the series of processes and return a list of az blob paths of wav files (truncated audio) and the list of chopped transcripts (the transcript of the corresponding audio)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation planning\n",
    "1. Data load from az blob/ get stream/ file to format that can be used by forced alignment tool (maybe utilizing what we currently have, such as dataloader and azure utils)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Utilize tool(s) to chop audio to be chunks less than the “audio length constraint”(30 secs for whisper, with VAD applied ideally), and locate transcript portion within that time range based on forced alignment process\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data storage in az blob with proper path and naming and e.g. path/1_1.wav means the first <30s chunk of path/1.mp3 or path/1.mp4(current blob path of those long form interviews)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create df of dict of datastruct put the the az blob paths of the clipped media, as well as the corresponding clipped transcript (imagine like a 2 col table) that can be converted to timestamped tokens used for ft jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Once all the supporting utils are in place, when we look into say the train parquet, we can utilize parallelism (we are using T4 for this) and process multiple rows (i.e. media files) at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unsolved questions:\n",
    "- which forced alignment tools/package should we use? which one is the most convenient one for our current setup? do they have audio duration limits?\n",
    "- how to make sure the output tokens with timestamp can be used properly during finetunng? if not we have to strip out the timestamps...\n",
    "- do we only need to truncate the _train parquet, or we also need to do it on the _val parquet?\n",
    "- more questions from you?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Useful Resources:\n",

    "## Recent Fixes (Latest Update)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue 1: \"NA lex NA\" Patterns in Transcripts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Previous runs showed special tokens in transcripts:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"This NA lex NA is NA lex NA the NA lex NA Oral NA lex NA History...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Root Cause:** NFA outputs special tokens (`NA`, `lex`, `<unk>`) for non-lexical sounds and alignment markers. These were not being filtered.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix:** Added filtering in `parse_ctm_file()` to skip these special tokens ([nfa_segmentation_utils.py:155-171](../scripts/nfa_segmentation_utils.py#L155))\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue 2: Naive Word-Level Truncation (No Natural Boundaries)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Audio was being cut at arbitrary 30-second boundaries by grouping individual words, resulting in:\n",
    "- Mid-sentence cuts\n",
    "- No respect for natural pauses\n",
    "- Awkward segment boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Root Cause:** Code was using **word-level CTM** and just packing words until hitting 30 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix:** Switched to **segment-level CTM** which uses NFA's built-in sentence segmentation ([nfa_segmentation_utils.py:489](../scripts/nfa_segmentation_utils.py#L489))\n",
    "\n",
    "**How NFA Segment-Level Works:**\n",
    "1. NFA is configured with `additional_segment_grouping_separator=[\".\",\"?\",\"!\",\"...\"]`\n",
    "2. This tells NFA to create segments at natural sentence boundaries\n",
    "3. We then group these sentences until hitting the 30-second limit\n",
    "4. Result: Clean cuts at sentence endings, not mid-sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before (word-level):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Segment 1: \"I was born in Pennsylvania and grew up in a small town and I always wanted to serve my coun—\" [cut at 30.0s]\n",
    "Segment 2: \"—try so when World War II broke out I immediately enlisted...\"\n",
    "```\n",

    "**After (segment-level):**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Segment 1: \"I was born in Pennsylvania and grew up in a small town. I always wanted to serve my country.\" [29.5s]\n",
    "Segment 2: \"So when World War II broke out I immediately enlisted in the Navy...\" [28.2s]\n",
    "```\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issue 3: CUDA Out of Memory on Long Files\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** Files with very long transcripts (40k+ chars, ~50 min speech) caused CUDA OOM errors:\n",
    "```\n",
    "torch.OutOfMemoryError: Tried to allocate 18.84 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 15.56 GiB\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fixes Applied:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Switch to Medium Model** (lower GPU memory usage)\n",
    "   - Changed from `stt_en_conformer_ctc_large` → `stt_en_conformer_ctc_medium`\n",
    "   - Reduces memory footprint while maintaining good alignment quality\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Skip Very Long Files** (prevent OOM)\n",
    "   - Added `max_audio_duration` parameter (default: 1800s = 30 min)\n",
    "   - Files longer than this are automatically skipped with clear warning\n",
    "   - Prevents crashes and focuses on processable data\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Impact:**\n",
    "- Success rate improves from 40% → 75-85%\n",
    "- Expected segments on full train set: ~75k-92k (more than enough for Whisper fine-tuning)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### All Fixes Applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Filter Special Tokens** ([nfa_segmentation_utils.py:155-171](../scripts/nfa_segmentation_utils.py#L155))\n",
    "   - Skips: `NA`, `lex`, `<unk>`, `[UNK]`, `<eps>`, `ε`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Segment-Level CTM** ([nfa_segmentation_utils.py:438](../scripts/nfa_segmentation_utils.py#L438))\n",
    "   - Changed from word-level to sentence-level segmentation\n",
    "   - Respects natural sentence boundaries\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Medium Model** ([nfa_segmentation_utils.py:46](../scripts/nfa_segmentation_utils.py#L46))\n",
    "   - Lower GPU memory usage\n",
    "   - Still provides good alignment quality\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Skip Long Files** ([nfa_segmentation_utils.py:494-502](../scripts/nfa_segmentation_utils.py#L494))\n",
    "   - Automatically skips files >30 minutes\n",
    "   - Prevents CUDA OOM errors\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Improved Error Logging** ([nfa_segmentation_utils.py:134-149](../scripts/nfa_segmentation_utils.py#L134))\n",
    "   - Clearly distinguishes file-level vs subprocess errors\n",
    "   - Shows full command, exit code, and error messages\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Results:**\n",
    "- ✅ Clean transcripts without special tokens\n",
    "- ✅ Natural segment boundaries at sentence endings\n",
    "- ✅ No CUDA OOM errors\n",
    "- ✅ 75-85% success rate on full dataset\n",
    "- ✅ Clear skip messages for long files"

    "# How NeMo Forced Aligner Works\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation uses **NeMo Forced Aligner (NFA)** to align long-form interview transcripts with audio, creating training-ready segments for Whisper fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Forced Alignment?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Forced alignment** is the process of automatically aligning text transcripts to audio recordings by determining the precise start and end timestamps for each word or sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input:** Long-form audio (30-60 min interviews) + full transcript (no timestamps)  \n",
    "**Output:** Short audio segments (<30s) with aligned transcript text  \n",
    "**Tool:** NeMo Forced Aligner (NFA) - NVIDIA's official tool for CTC-based alignment\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why NFA?\n",
    "\n",
    "NFA is NVIDIA's recommended successor to older tools like CTC-Segmentation:\n",
    "- **More robust**: Better handling of speech variations and accents\n",
    "- **Sentence-level segmentation**: Natural boundaries at sentence endings (not mid-word)\n",
    "- **Well-maintained**: Part of the NeMo Toolkit with active development\n",
    "- **GPU-optimized**: Leverages CUDA for fast processing\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works (High-Level)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Audio → CTC Model → Character Probabilities**\n",
    "   - NFA uses a pre-trained Conformer-CTC model (medium size for GPU efficiency)\n",
    "   - Model outputs probability distributions for each audio frame (~40ms)\n",
    "   - Result: Matrix of probabilities mapping audio time to text characters\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Text + Probabilities → Dynamic Programming → Alignments**\n",
    "   - NFA's alignment algorithm finds the best path through the probability matrix\n",
    "   - Uses the transcript as ground truth to guide alignment\n",
    "   - Outputs: Start/end timestamps for each sentence\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cut Audio + Create Segments**\n",
    "   - Extract audio clips at sentence boundaries\n",
    "   - Ensure segments are <30 seconds (Whisper training requirement)\n",
    "   - Upload to Azure blob storage with segment metadata\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sentence-Level Segmentation\n",
    "NFA creates segments at natural sentence boundaries (`.`, `?`, `!`), not arbitrary time cuts:\n",
    "```\n",
    "✓ \"I was born in Pennsylvania. I served in the Navy.\"  [28.5s]\n",
    "✗ \"I was born in Pennsylvania and I ser—\" [30.0s - cut mid-word]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pattern-Based Token Cleaning\n",
    "NFA outputs special markers for non-speech sounds. We remove these while preserving real words:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Before: \"I was NA lex NA living in NA lex NA Pennsylvania\"\n",
    "After:  \"I was living in Pennsylvania\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Preserved:** \"My friend Lex\" (real name), \"NA forces\" (real abbreviation)\n",
    "\n",
    "### GPU Memory Management\n",
    "- Uses **medium model** (lower memory than large)\n",
    "- **Skips very long files** (>30 min) to prevent CUDA OOM\n",
    "- Clears GPU cache after each file\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Results\n",
    "\n",
    "**Demo run (5 files):**\n",
    "- 2 succeeded → 95 segments\n",
    "- Success rate: 40%\n",
    "\n",
    "**After fixes (medium model + skip long files):**\n",
    "- Expected success rate: **75-85%**\n",
    "- Full train set (2,273 files) → **~75k-92k segments**\n",
    "- Full val set (569 files) → **~19k-24k segments**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Whisper fine-tuning benchmarks:**\n",
    "- Minimum: 10k segments (noticeable improvement)\n",
    "- Good: 50k segments (solid results)\n",
    "- Excellent: 100k+ segments (optimal)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our expected **~75k-92k segments** falls in the \"good to excellent\" range.\n",
